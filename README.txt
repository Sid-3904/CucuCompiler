FINAL PROJECT CS202
CUCU Language Compiler

Description:
This project consists of a lexer and parser implementation for a C-like language called CUCU.

Files:
- cucu.l: Lexer file written in Flex, responsible for tokenizing input CUCU code.
- cucu.y: Parser file written in Bison, responsible for parsing the tokens generated by the lexer and building a parse code.
- Sample1.cu: Sample CUCU code for testing the lexer and parser.
- Sample2.cu: Sample CUCU code for testing the lexer and parser.
- Lexer.txt: Output file containing the tokens generated by the lexer.
- Parser.txt: Output file containing the parse tree generated by the parser.
- README.txt: ReadMe file for direction to use.
Usage:
   - To compile and run the lexer and parser, use the following commands(in windows):

flex cucu.l
bison -d cucu.y
gcc cucu.tab.c lex.yy.c -o cucu
cucu.exe

   - The lexer and parser will run on the sample code provided in Sample1.cu, and the output will be written to Lexer.txt and Parser.txt respectively.
